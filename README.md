CreateSentences("/Users/abhishaikemahajan/Documents/RandomTextFiles/META.txt", '/Users/abhishaikemahajan/Documents/Wakapedia/texter.txt', 20)
```
where:
```
CreateSentences(FILE_PATH_OF_INPUT, FILE_PATH_OF_OLDSTUFF, NUMSENTENCES):
```
FILE_PATH_OF_INPUT is the file path of the text file you want the generated text to focus on
